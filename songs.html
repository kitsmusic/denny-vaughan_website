For one command I stand, and wait now. From one who's master of my fate now. I can't escape for it's too late now, I'm just a prisoner of love. What's the good of my caring If someone is sharing those arms with me. Although she has another I can't have another for I'm not free. She's in my dreams, awake or sleeping. Upon my knees, to her I'm creeping. My very life is in her keeping, I'm just a prisoner of love. She's in my dreams, awake or sleeping. Upon my knees, to her I'm creeping. My very life is in her keeping, I'm just a prisoner of love."

My thoughts begin to hum, to the pitter pat pat of the rain. Feelin' drowsy, the words no longer clear. I close my eyes, pretending you are near. I hear you whisper \"I love you so\", Can you wonder, I love to go, to bed early, with a dream to dream of you."

Every rose is blushing as she passes by, they see the love light in her eye, for Cynthia's in Love. Every night when the stars are playing peek-a-boo, you will find her in a rendezvous, starry eyes, breathing sighs.

His snowy hair was so much whiter, Beneath the candle glow, The old lamplighter, Of long, long ago. You'd hear the patter of his feet, As he came toddling down the street, His smile would hide a lonely heart you see. If there were sweethearts in the park, He'd pass a lamp and leave it dark, Remembering the days that used to be. For he recalled when dreams were new, He loved someone who loved him too, Who walks with him alone in memories. He made the night a little brighter, Wherever he would go, The old lamplighter of long, long ago. Now if you look up in the sky, You'll understand the reason why, The little stars at night are all aglow. He turns them on when night is near, He turns them off when dawn is near, The little man we loved of long ago."

She can look into the crystal and see, What your fortune and your future will be, And they tell me the crystal, Has never lied. It seems that this weaver of dreams, Deals in romance all the day through. But her life's not the romance it seems, (Her own dreams never come true). She can soon arrange a stranger's affairs, But she tries to hide the worries and cares, Of the one broken romance, She'll never mend. (It seems that this weaver of dreams, Deals in romance all the day through). But her life's not the romance it seems (Her own dreams never come true).

I never saw anyone more than once, maybe twice, But I had no ties until my eyes saw you. I may have kissed one or two, three or four, maybe more. But after all, I didn't fall, And who they were I can't recall. For I never loved anyone, any time, any place, With anything like the love I feel for you. I may have kissed one or two, three or four, or maybe more. But after all I didn't fall, And who they were I can't recall. For I never loved anyone, any time, or any place, With anything like the love I feel for you. For everything that I love, I find in you."

Without a golden wand or mystic charms, Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms. When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland. It's magic. How else can I explain those rainbows when there is no rain? It's magic. Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true, When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you? Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?"

                lyrics: "When they begin the beguine, It brings back the sound of music so tender, It brings back a night of tropical splendour, It brings back a memory evergreen. I'm with you once more under the stars, And down by the shore an orchestra's playing, And even the palms seem to be swaying, When they begin the beguine. To live it again is past all endeavour, Except when that tune clutches my heart, And there we are, swearing to love forever, And promising never, never to part. What moments divine, what rapture serene, Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted, And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted, I know but too well what they mean. So don't let them begin the beguine, Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember. Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember, When they begin the beguine. Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play, Till the stars that were there before return above you, Till you whisper to me once more, \"Darling, I love you!\" And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in, When they begin the beguine."

The darkest night would shine, If you would come to me soon. Until you will, how still my heart, How high the moon? Until I fell in love, my life was very easy, the moon just made it moon light, the breeze just made it breezy. And then I fell in love, and things that once were clear, now I scarcely see or hear. Somewhere there's music, It's where you are. Somewhere there's heaven, How near, how far? The darkest night would shine, If you would come to me soon. Until you will, how still my heart, How high the moon? Be still my heart, How high the moon?"

Whether near to me or far, It's no matter, Darling, where you are, I think of you Night and day. Day and night. Why is it so? That this longing for you follows, Where-ever I go? In the roaring traffic's boom, In the silence of my lonely room, I think of you, Night and day. Night and day, Under the hide of me, There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning, Burning inside of me. And its torment won't be through, Til you let me spend my life making love to you, Day and night, Night and day."
